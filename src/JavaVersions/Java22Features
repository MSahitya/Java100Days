Java 22 introduced several exciting features and enhancements. Here's a summary:

1. **Unnamed Variables and Patterns**: Simplified code by allowing unused variables or patterns to be replaced with an underscore (`_`).
2. **Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs**: Enabled running multiple `.java` files without prior compilation.
3. **Statements Before `super()` (Preview)**: Allowed certain statements in constructors before calling `super()` or `this()`.
4. **Stream Gatherers (Preview)**: Introduced intermediate stream operations for better data processing.
5. **Foreign Function & Memory API**: Finalized after multiple preview rounds, improving native code and memory interaction.
6. **Scoped Values (Second Preview)**: Continued development of safer alternatives to thread-local variables.
7. **String Templates (Second Preview)**: Enhanced dynamic string construction.
8. **Vector API (Seventh Incubator)**: Further refined for high-performance vector computations.
9. **Deprecations and Removals**: Removed outdated features like `Thread.countStackFrames` and the old core reflection implementation.
