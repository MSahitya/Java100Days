Java 15 introduced several notable features and enhancements. Here's a summary:

1. **Sealed Classes (Preview)**: Allowed developers to restrict which classes can extend or implement a given class or interface.
2. **Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Second Preview)**: Simplified type checks and casts in a single step.
3. **Records (Second Preview)**: Continued refining immutable data classes with minimal boilerplate.
4. **Text Blocks (Standard)**: Made multiline string literals a standard feature.
5. **Hidden Classes**: Introduced classes that are not discoverable by regular class loaders, useful for frameworks.
6. **Removal of Nashorn JavaScript Engine**: Deprecated and removed the Nashorn engine from the JDK.
7. **Reimplementation of DatagramSocket API**: Modernized the implementation for better performance and maintainability.
8. **Shenandoah Garbage Collector**: Added support for low-pause-time garbage collection.
9. **Foreign-Memory Access API (Second Incubator)**: Improved handling of memory outside the Java heap.
