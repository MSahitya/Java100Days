Java 20 introduced several preview and incubator features aimed at enhancing developer productivity and platform capabilities. Here's a summary:

1. **Scoped Values (Incubator)**: Provided a safer and more efficient alternative to thread-local variables for sharing immutable data within threads.
2. **Record Patterns (Second Preview)**: Improved destructuring of record values for concise and readable code.
3. **Pattern Matching for `switch` (Fourth Preview)**: Further refined pattern matching for `switch` statements.
4. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Preview)**: Enhanced interaction with native code and memory.
5. **Virtual Threads (Second Preview)**: Continued development of lightweight threads for high-throughput concurrent programming.
6. **Structured Concurrency (Second Incubator)**: Simplified multithreaded programming by treating tasks as a single unit of work.
