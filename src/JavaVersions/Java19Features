2. **Structured Concurrency (Incubator)**: Simplifies multithreaded programming by treating tasks as a single unit of work.
3. **Pattern Matching for `switch` (Third Preview)**: Further refined pattern matching for `switch` statements.
4. **Record Patterns (Preview)**: Enabled deconstruction of record values for more expressive data processing.
5. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview)**: Improved interaction with native code and memory.
6. **Vector API (Fourth Incubator)**: Enhanced performance for vector computations.
7. **Linux/RISC-V Port**: Added support for the RISC-V architecture on Linux.
