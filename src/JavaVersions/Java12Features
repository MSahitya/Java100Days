Java 12 introduced several enhancements and features to improve developer experience and performance. Here's a summary:

1. **Switch Expressions (Preview)**: Simplified switch statements with concise syntax and better readability.
2. **File Mismatch Method**: Added `Files.mismatch()` to compare two files and return the position of the first mismatch.
3. **Compact Number Formatting**: Enhanced number formatting for compact representations (e.g., "1K" for 1000).
4. **Default CDS Archives**: Improved startup performance by using default class data sharing (CDS) archives.
5. **Shenandoah Garbage Collector**: Introduced a low-pause garbage collector for better application responsiveness.
